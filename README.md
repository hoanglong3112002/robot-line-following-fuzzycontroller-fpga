DESIGN OF  FUZZY LOGIC CONTROLLER FOR LINE FOLLOWER ROBOT ON FPGA PLATFORM

This project was carried out as part of my studies in Computer Engineering Technology.
The goal was to design and implement an autonomous line-following robot using an FPGA platform combined with a fuzzy logic controller for smooth navigation on curved paths.
Objective: To design and build an autonomous line-following robot using FPGA, combined with a fuzzy logic controller to ensure accurate movement along curved paths.

Main Features:

  -Controller: FPGA (Cyclone IV E: EP4CE6F17C8)
  
  -Algorithm: Fuzzy Logic Control
  
  -Sensors: Infrared sensors for line detection
  
  -Motor Control: PWM-based speed control

  -Node-RED User Interface (Start/Stop control, Speed reference adjustment, Real-time position monitoring (mapview), User authentication required, Real-time speed monitoring)
